## My vim configuration

1. Clone this repo to your $HOME
2. And create the following symlinks:

```sh
ln -s vim-stuff/ .vim
ln -s vim-stuff/vimrc .vimrc
```

It uses [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as a plugin manager.

#### **Additional Requirements:**

Must have [Powerline patched fonts](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts) for vim-airline status bar plugin.
Then follow the instructions from that repository in order to install those fonts.
